    Ok, so I am not really a trekie but I just couldn't pass it up.  Another thing that I am not really into is blogging; nonetheless, here I am just a few days into Dev Bootcamp and I am already writing the second blog of my life.  Early on in my process of researching the various programming bootcamps my impression of Dev Bootcamp is that it was a little touchy feely and to be honest, that kind of made me a little uncomfortable.  However, the more I read about Dev Bootcamp and watched videos online about their Engineering Empathy Curriculum I started to realize how the culture makes real world practical sense and actually isn't all that different then who I am and how I learn.

    Ok, so what is my take on the DBC experience so far?  Well I started out feeling like wow there is a lot of information, resources and deliverables out there and they all seem to live somewhere in this labyrinth of hyper-links.  At first. this was a little overwhelming and I started to feel a little of that "I am Not Good Enough" fear that Shereef talked about in his Fireside Chat video.  As I continued to work my way through the maze and saw posts from my cohorts, I realized that we are all in the same place and figuring it out together.  As the week progressed I started to feel much better, I feel like I have a grasp on the logistics and how to navigate my way through the curriculum (Hopefully this isn't newbie ignorance.) Made it through most of the challenges and really feeling good and then I get to the blogs...

    Right back to the "I am Not Good Enough" fears. I pushed through the technical blog thinking "Ok, not too bad" but now you want me to write about my feelings.  So I watched Shereefs Fireside Chat video and I thought about my experiences throughout the week and it ll started to make sense to me.  When I think of Shereef's chefs in the kitchen analogy, I start to understand that the biggest lesson that we had this week is that if we are all engaged as a cohort and together we jump in, roll up our sleeves and learn together we will navigate our way to reaching our goals.  Once again, the "Not Good Enough" fear has subsided and I am really excited to start to really work together with my fellow cohorts next week.

    P.S. I am sure the fears will be back at least one or two more times... A Day.
