  <h1>NorCalDavid's Journey in Becoming a Developer at Dev Bootcamp</h1>
  <h2>Phase 0 - Week 1 Version Control ... How and Why?</h2>
  <h4>Friday, May 1, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      As I approach the end of the first week on my journey at Dev Bootcamp I stop to think about the things that I have learned and and the many things that are still to come.  Week one was filled with information that is starting to lay the foundation for the many beautiful things that we will build along this journey.  In construction, you start with a solid foundation before you start building walls.  This week started working on our foundation by learning about the commnd line as well as git and GitHub.  While it is evident that my understanding of both will be critical to my success as a developer, I will focus on the benefits of version control and explain how git and GitHub help developers manage it.
